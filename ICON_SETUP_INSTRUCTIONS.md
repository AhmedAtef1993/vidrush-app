# VidRush App Icon and Splash Screen Setup

## Instructions for Setting Up Images

### 1. App Icon Setup
1. **Copy your app icon image** to `assets/images/1.png`
   - The image should be square format (e.g., 1024x1024 pixels)
   - PNG format recommended
   - High quality with transparent background if possible

### 2. Splash Screen Setup
1. **Copy your splash screen image** to `assets/images/2.png`
   - The image should be square format (e.g., 1024x1024 pixels)
   - PNG format recommended
   - High quality

### 3. After Adding Images
Once you've added both images to the assets/images/ folder:

1. **Enable app icon generation** - Uncomment the flutter_launcher_icons section in pubspec.yaml
2. **Update splash screen** - Change the splash screen back to use your image
3. **Generate icons** - Run:
```bash
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

### 3. Generate App Icons
After replacing the images, run the following command to generate app icons for all platforms:

```bash
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

### 4. Build the App
After setting up the images and generating icons, you can build the app:

```bash
# For Android
flutter build apk

# For iOS
flutter build ios

# For Web
flutter build web
```
